# github-user-map

A very simple react app that looks up a github user and shows their approximate location on a map. Most of the code is borrowed from [ReactJS: GitHub User Cards](http://codepen.io/simonswiss/pen/LpBWax).

Made during a [MaptimePDX](http://maptime.io/portland/) meetup led by [jgravois](https://github.com/jgravois).
