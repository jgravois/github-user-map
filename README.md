# github-user-map

A simple app that looks up a github user and shows their approximate location on a map.

Adapted from [ReactJS: GitHub User Cards](http://codepen.io/simonswiss/pen/LpBWax).

I ended up making two versions:

### [React](react)

Made during a [MaptimePDX](http://maptime.io/portland/) meetup led by [jgravois](https://github.com/jgravois).

### [hyperx](hyperx)

Made to compare a [hyperx](https://github.com/substack/hyperx)/[main-loop](https://github.com/Raynos/main-loop) implementation with react. Way less tooling headaches.
